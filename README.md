Prime Number Algorithm

An algorithm for generating prime numbers. 
This is a proof of concept implementation and isn't yet optimized. 
This repository includes the TEX article and Mathemtaica notebook, which compares the complexity of the algorithm as the number of characteristics computed to that of a well-known algorithm, the Sieve of Atkin.
